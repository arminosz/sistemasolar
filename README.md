# ðŸŒŒ Solar System Simulation

The **Solar System Simulation** is a real-time accelerated map of our solar system created in **Java**. This program visualizes the planets orbiting around the Sun at an accelerated speed of **1 day per second**, making it easy to observe the dynamics of our celestial neighbors

## ðŸš€ Features
<sub>Note: This program is a amateur and totally inaccurate simulation and not intended for educational purposes. Always consult professional astronomical resources for accurate information </sub>
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Watch the solar system in action as planets orbit the Sun at 1 day per second
- **Adjustable Speed**: Change the simulation speed with the click of a button (up to 100x)
- **Interactive UI**: Click on planets to get detailed information about their characteristics
- **Visual Representation**: See the planets represented in a graphical interface using **Java Swing**

## ðŸ“‹ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java **11** or higher
- An IDE or text editor of your choice

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arminosz/sistemasolar.git
   cd sistemasolar
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

^ (Or run the java file in cmd with `java SistemaSolar.java`) 

3. Run the `SistemaSolar.java` file to start the simulation.

### Usage

1. Upon running the program, a window will open displaying the solar system
2. You can change the speed of the simulation by clicking the **Speed** button in the top panel
3. Click on any planet to view detailed information, such as size, orbital period, Delta-V for hohmann transfer etc

### Controls

- **Speed Button**: Toggles the speed of the simulation between **1x, 10x, 50x**, and **100x**.
